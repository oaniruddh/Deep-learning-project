ðŸš€ Getting Started
Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.6 or higher

TensorFlow 2.x

Keras Tuner

Matplotlib

You can install the necessary Python packages using pip:

pip install tensorflow keras-tuner matplotlib

Running the Project

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/oaniruddh/Deep-learning-project.git
cd Deep-learning-project


Execute the desired script:

python 'CNN on CIFAR-10.py'


Replace 'CNN on CIFAR-10.py' with the appropriate script name to run different experiments.

ðŸ“Š Results

The project includes visualizations of training and validation accuracy and loss over epochs. These plots help in understanding the model's performance and identifying potential overfitting or underfitting issues.
